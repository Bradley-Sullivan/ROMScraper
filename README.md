## Description
ROMScraper is a tool used to scrape game console ROMs (and other files) from `archive.org` collections that can then be searched and downloaded. 

The UI was designed using the Python curses module. HTML parsing/scraping was built using the requests and BeautifulSoup Python modules. Search engine was constructed using the Python scikit_learn, panda, and numpy modules.

Search options include searching all provided collections, searching by specific consoles, browsing specific collecitons, and browsing favorited ROMs/other files.
